Joe quickly realized that he had a passion for the Hardscape industry and enjoyed the fact that each job was its own custom project that has to be detailed and designed for each customer’s taste.',

This project was the turning point in J&D Landscaping and solidified the decision by Joe to focus only on Hardscape projects. Joe’s passion has only grown more over the years and he feels Hardscaping is a skill and an art. Joe believes Hardscaping is not something that should be doneon the side or done 1 or 2 days a week in between mowing lawns and landscaping. He and his team exclusively focus on Hardscape projects and specialize in creating the specific design of your choice.',
